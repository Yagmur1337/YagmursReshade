# Depth estimation optional downloads

These files are downloaded separately by the RobloxShadeHost installer when you select the depth estimation add-on. They are not bundled in the installer executable. The two DLLs and `downloads.ini` from this folder are assets of the `depth-assets` release. The model is downloaded straight from Hugging Face at a pinned commit.

- `onnxruntime.dll`: ONNX Runtime 1.24.4 with the DirectML execution provider, from the `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML` NuGet package (`runtimes/win-x64/native/onnxruntime.dll`). MIT license, Microsoft Corporation.
- `DirectML.dll`: DirectML 1.15.4, from the `Microsoft.AI.DirectML` NuGet package (`bin/x64-win/DirectML.dll`). Microsoft Software License Terms, which allow redistribution in applications; the terms are in `LICENSE.txt` of that package.
- `depth-anything-v2-small.onnx`: Depth Anything V2 Small (ViT-S), float16 ONNX export `onnx/model_fp16.onnx` from [onnx-community/depth-anything-v2-small](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/depth-anything-v2-small), saved under this name. Apache-2.0 license. Model by Lihe Yang and others, [Depth Anything V2](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2).

The host builds against the ONNX Runtime 1.24.4 headers, so replace `onnxruntime.dll` only with the same or a newer 1.x release of the DirectML build. The model must be a Depth Anything V2 export with `batch_size`, `height` and `width` as its free input dimensions and float32 or float16 tensors.

These third-party files are not covered by RobloxShadeHost's MIT license. Their inclusion does not imply endorsement by their authors.

The installer reads `downloads.ini` from this release and verifies all three SHA-256 checksums before installing them. If any download is unavailable or fails verification, it skips depth estimation and completes the remaining installation.
